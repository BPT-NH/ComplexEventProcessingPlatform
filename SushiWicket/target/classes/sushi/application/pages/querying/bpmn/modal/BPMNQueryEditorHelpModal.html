    	<h4>Event Types</h4>
    	In the first step, create event types for the monitoring points in the BPMN process model.
    	Event types can be created in the Event Repository.
    	<h4>Process</h4>
    	Every BPMN process needs a standard process as connection, therefore one has to be created. 
    	It is possible to create a process in the Event Repository or during the upload of a BPMN process in the fourth step.
    	<h4>Correlation</h4>
    	The correlation assigns every relevant event to a process instance which is necessary for the BPMN query execution.
    	It is required to determine a correlation for the created process with the created event types.
    	<h4>BPMN process</h4>
    	Before creating the queries, import a BPMN process. 
    	The BPMN file should have the *bpmn20.xml format and should be linked to the created process at the BPMN process upload.
    	<h4>BPMN queries</h4>
    	In order to create the queries from the BPMN process for process monitoring, click the "Create Queries"-button on this page.
