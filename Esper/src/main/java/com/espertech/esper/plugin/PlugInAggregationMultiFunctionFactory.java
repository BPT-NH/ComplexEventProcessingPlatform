/**
 * Entry point for the extension API for aggregation multi-functions.
 * <p>
 *     This API allows adding one or more related aggregation functions that can share state,
 *     share parameters or exhibit related behavior.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Please use {@link com.espertech.esper.client.ConfigurationPlugInAggregationMultiFunction}
 *     to register this factory class in the engine together with one or more function names.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The engine instantiates a single instance of this class at the time it encounters the first
 *     aggregation multi-function in a given statement at the time of statement parsing or
 *     compilation from statement object model.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     At the time of statement parsing, each aggregation multi-function encountered during parsing
 *     of EPL statement text results in an invocation to {@link #addAggregationFunction(PlugInAggregationMultiFunctionDeclarationContext)}. The same
 *     upon statement compilation for statement object model.
 *     For multiple aggregation functions, the order in which such calls occur is not well defined
 *     and should not be relied on by the implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The engine invokes {@link #validateGetHandler(PlugInAggregationMultiFunctionValidationContext)}
 *     at the time of expression node validation. Validation occurs after statement parsing
 *     and when type information is established.
 *     For multiple aggregation functions, the order in which such calls occur is not well defined
 *     and should not be relied on by the implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Usually a single {@link PlugInAggregationMultiFunctionHandler} handler class can handle the needs
 *     of all related aggregation functions.
 *     Usually you have a single handler class and return one handler object for each
 *     aggregation function expression, where the handler object takes the validation context as a parameter.
 *     Use multiple different handler classes when your aggregation
 *     functions have sufficiently different execution contexts or behaviors. Your application may want to use the
 *     expression and type information available in
 *     {@link PlugInAggregationMultiFunctionValidationContext} to decide what behavior to provide.
 * </p>
