********
Signavio is a company providing professional tools for process modeling and analysis. 
Signavio donates parts of their former commercial components, mostly in the direction 
of an alternative model repository and explorer.

The file-based backend maintained in this code repository allows an easy integration 
with typical development environments.

This project contains special build configurations for an integration with the process execution 
engine Activiti. Activiti uses the BPMN 2.0 DI XML format that is automatically stored on your file
system when modeling BPMN 2.0 diagrams.
